# Wulechuan's Rainbow Bash Prompt


## 简体中文指南（Chinese Simplified Version of ReadMe）

中文版《使用指南》[在此](./Bash-rainbow-prompt-string-ReadMe.zh-CN.md)。



## Introduction

Bring rainbows into your bash compatible environments.

This is a tool for building a colorful **prompt string** in
a command line interface (CLI) environment.

It obeys the Bash syntax, thus applies to any Linux Terminal,
Apple macOSX terminal,
the Microsoft Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment,
as well as all kinds of Linux Terminal Simulators such as GitBash and Cygwin.

It does **NOT** apply to Microsoft Windows CMD,
or Microsoft Windows PowerShell,
or Microsoft PowerShell for Linux.
Because the syntax of either CMD or PowerShell is completely
different from that of a Bash compatible environment.






## Features

1.  The chief part of the prompt string happens to be
    an SSH connection string. So you can just copy
    that part to easily create an SSH connection.
2.  The prefixed Date and timestamp is helpful
    on tracing back our command history.
3.  The distinct rainbow strips, naturally form
    visual blocks between them, helping we human beings
    to distinguish scopes of command from record to record.
4.  Beautiful (but your might NOT agree with that).


## Installation

1.  Copy the entire `bash-rainbow-prompt` folder to your bash
    `~` folder (or "directory" if you prefer).

1.  If your bash `~` folder doesn't contain a file named
    `.bash_profile` yet, create a text file with that name
    by executing:
    ```sh
    touch ~/.bash_profile
    ```

    > Note that there is a dot(`.`) sign at the beginning of the file name.

3.  Edit your `~/.bash_profile` file, inserting (appending is just fine) a line
    as shown below:

    ```sh
    source ~/bash-rainbow-prompt/load.sh
    ```

    Save your modifications.


1.  Make things happen. There're 2 senarios:

    1.  For any newly opened Bash window from that moment on,
        this set of scripts automatically take effects.
        There is nothing you need to do.

    1.  For those already opened Bash windows at the moment,
        simply execute this line below:

        ```sh
        exec bash -l
        ```

## About `git-prompt.sh`

When you are working in your Bash environment,
this tool of mine optionally allows you to see some nice details
of a git branch status right beneath the chief prompt string,
as long as you are working on a folder that is configured
as a part of a git repository.

This nice optional feature needs a well known utility named
`git-prompt.sh`, which is licensed under GNU GPL 2.0.

While I'm not going to license my tool
under any licensing system (but this means it happens to match a
license called WTFPL, cool), I cannot provide the `git-prompt.sh`
tool right inside my repository.

If you need the feature,
you have to download the `git-prompt.sh` (yes, it's a single file)
yourself and put it inside this folder:
```sh
~/bash-rainbow-prompt/GNU-tools
```

which means the file will be:
```sh
~/bash-rainbow-prompt/GNU-tools/git-prompt.sh
```

> See https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh

Besides, although the `git-prompt.sh` is really powerful at
providing details of a git branch, it **CAN** be very slow in situations.
**So use it at your own consideration**.




## Configuration

### The Configuration File
The only configuration file of this tool is:
```sh
<This Repository>/~/bash-rainbow-prompt/configurations.sh
```

You may put some configuration entries in the file
to customize the look of your prompt.


### Configuration Entries


#### `WLC_RAINBOW_PROMPT___SHOULD_USE_DETAILED_BUT_SLOW_GIT_BRANCH_INFO_QUERY`

This variable controls whether or not we shall use the `git-prompt.sh`.

Possible values: any value is allowed, but only the `'yes'` means
"yes please enable showing details of git branch state".
It is allowed to be even omitted at all, which means `'no'`.





#### `WLC_RAINBOW_PROMPT___COLORS_ARE_IN_BACKGROUNDS_INSTEAD_OF_TEXTS`

This entry controls whether colors are applied to texts or background.
The default value is `'yes'`.

- When this entry is omitted, aka not defined,
or this entry is defined as `'yes'`, the prompt looks like these pictures:

    - when in 256-colored mode
    ![256-colored mode; WLC_RAINBOW_PROMPT___COLORS_ARE_IN_BACKGROUNDS_INSTEAD_OF_TEXTS = 'yes'](./illustrates/bash-rainbow-prompt-example-wulechuan-256-colors.png "256-colored mode; WLC_RAINBOW_PROMPT___COLORS_ARE_IN_BACKGROUNDS_INSTEAD_OF_TEXTS = 'yes'")

    - when in 16-colored mode
    ![16-colored mode; WLC_RAINBOW_PROMPT___COLORS_ARE_IN_BACKGROUNDS_INSTEAD_OF_TEXTS = 'yes'](./illustrates/bash-rainbow-prompt-example-wulechuan-16-colors.png "16-colored mode; WLC_RAINBOW_PROMPT___COLORS_ARE_IN_BACKGROUNDS_INSTEAD_OF_TEXTS = 'yes'")

<br>

- When this entry is defined but the value is not `'yes'`, the prompt looks like these pictures:

    - when in 256-colored mode
    ![256-colored mode; WLC_RAINBOW_PROMPT___COLORS_ARE_IN_BACKGROUNDS_INSTEAD_OF_TEXTS != 'yes'](./illustrates/bash-rainbow-prompt-example-wulechuan-256-colors-in-text.png "256-colored mode; WLC_RAINBOW_PROMPT___COLORS_ARE_IN_BACKGROUNDS_INSTEAD_OF_TEXTS != 'yes'")

    - when in 16-colored mode
    ![16-colored mode; WLC_RAINBOW_PROMPT___COLORS_ARE_IN_BACKGROUNDS_INSTEAD_OF_TEXTS != 'yes'](./illustrates/bash-rainbow-prompt-example-wulechuan-16-colors-in-text.png "16-colored mode; WLC_RAINBOW_PROMPT___COLORS_ARE_IN_BACKGROUNDS_INSTEAD_OF_TEXTS != 'yes'")






#### `wlcRainbowPrompt_256Colored_color[n]`

There're 10 colors of this kind at present:
```sh
wlcRainbowPrompt_256Colored_color1=210
wlcRainbowPrompt_256Colored_color2=216
wlcRainbowPrompt_256Colored_color3=229
wlcRainbowPrompt_256Colored_color4=120
wlcRainbowPrompt_256Colored_color5=49
wlcRainbowPrompt_256Colored_color6=87
wlcRainbowPrompt_256Colored_color7=45
wlcRainbowPrompt_256Colored_color8=39
wlcRainbowPrompt_256Colored_color9=69
wlcRainbowPrompt_256Colored_color10=63
```

They represent all colors used in the prompt chief part.
And the alphabetical order or these variables name match
the order of colors counting from left to right.






#### `wlcRainbowPrompt_256Colored_colorGitBranchInfo[n]`

There are 2 colors of this kind:
```sh
wlcRainbowPrompt_256Colored_gitBranchInfoColor1=219
wlcRainbowPrompt_256Colored_gitBranchInfoColor2=223
```

-   The first color is used when the `WLC_RAINBOW_PROMPT___COLORS_ARE_IN_BACKGROUNDS_INSTEAD_OF_TEXTS`
    is omitted or is `'yes'`;

-   The second color is used when the `WLC_RAINBOW_PROMPT___COLORS_ARE_IN_BACKGROUNDS_INSTEAD_OF_TEXTS`
    is **not** `'yes'`.

> Note that this color is **always** applied to the git branch info string texts,
> never the background.







#### `wlcRainbowPrompt_256Colored_gitBranchInfoBracketsColor`

This entry set the colors of those `[` and `]`
around the git branch info string.

> Note that this color is **always** applied to the `[` and `]` characters,
> never the background.

## Appendix

### Color Palette

This tool also comes with a customized color palette, which
is meant to used in an 8-colored (but provides 16 colors in fact)
environment. It provides some vivid colors and is hopefully
to make your console colors more attractive.

It's here:
```sh
<This Repository>/~/.mintty/themes/bash16-wulechuan.minttyrc
```

Try it at your own interests.

For the 256-colored bash environments, the color palette is useless.
Because the built-in color table is not adjustable there.



#### How to use (apply) a color palette

The way to apply a color palette file varies according to the target environments.
Some can utilize the provided `.minttyrc` file directly
without any pain, as long as the `.minttyrc` file is
located in the correct folder.
Others can not,
so you have to apply color values one by one manually.

##### Use the color palette file in Cygwin for Windows

1.  Copy the **entire `~/.mintty` folder** to
    inside of your own `~` folder.

    > Note1: Make sure you copy the entire folder
    > instead of copying only the color-palette file.

    > Note2：The Cygwin treats the `%UserProfile%` to be your `~` folder.

1.  Run Cygwin.

1.  Mouse-right-click the title bar of your Cygwin window,
    chose `Options...`. This opens the `Options` dialog
    of the mintty program.

1.  Click the first tab on the leftside, aka the `Looks`.

1.  Find the dropdown list named `Theme`,
    chose `base16-wulechuan.minttyrc` there.

6.  Press either the `Save` button or the `Apply` button.
    Immediately you see changes in colors.



##### Use the color palette in Windows Console

Althought my `bash-rainbow-prompt` tool does **NOT** apply
to Microsoft Windows CMD or PowerShell, the color palette
is somehow applicable. All is that, the application takes
some manual work.

And if applied, both the CMD and the PowerShell are effected.

1.  Run a CMD or PowerShell, so that you open up a Windows Console window.
2.  Mouse-right-click the title bar of the Console window, the chose `default`.
    This opens the `Console Properties` dialog.
3.  Enter the 4th tab, aka the `colors` tab.
4.  Manually copy color values inside
    the `.mintty/themes/base16-wulechuan.minttyrc` file I provide,
    one by one, into the `Console Properties` dialog.
    > Note that the order the colors are in,
    > inside the `base16-wulechuan.minttyrc` file,
    > matches the order of the color slots inside
    > the `Console Properties` dialog.
5.  Press `OK` button to save your modifications.
    Immediately you see changes in colors.
